* Make "buttons" compatible with drag-scrolling

* mouse-1 or RET in the call list should mark call as old, on message
  it should mark it as read

* Make <TAB> focus the nearest button, and M-<TAB> previous

* Give user information about number of parts and chars left when
  composing a message

* Optionally provide info about unread messages and missed calls in
  the global mode line (the modeline item should be clickable and
  switch to the call buffer if there's an active call, to the calllist
  if there're new missed calls, to the message list if there're unread
  messages, otherwise to the status buffer)

* Provide customisation means for contact list format

* "Call" and "Message" in contact list should honor the "point": it
  should specify which phone-number (or even sip/email) to use
