* Make "buttons" compatible with drag-scrolling

* Make <TAB> focus the nearest button, and M-<TAB> previous

* Give user information about number of parts and chars left when
  composing a message

* Optionally provide info about unread messages and missed calls in
  the global mode line (the modeline item should be clickable and
  switch to the call buffer if there's an active call, to the calllist
  if there're new missed calls, to the message list if there're unread
  messages, otherwise to the status buffer)

* Provide customisation means for contact list format

* "Call" and "Message" in contact list should honor the "point": it
  should specify which phone-number (or even sip/email) to use


Things to consider:

* BBDB integration: how do you expect it to work, usecases, handling
  differences between opimd and bbdb conceptions

* linphone.el integration (does anyone need that in reality?)

* GPRS traffic counters
